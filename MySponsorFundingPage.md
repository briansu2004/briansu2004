## Smart Basketball Court System

To ensure fair foul judgments in basketball games with friends, I am creating a system that leverages **sensor technology and AI algorithms**.

### 1. **Smart Basketball Equipments**

Integrate sensors and AI to record match data in real-time and automatically determine fouls.

#### (1) **Wearable Devices**

- **Smart Wristbands or Protective Gear**: Each player wears lightweight smart devices (e.g., wristbands, knee pads) equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors to monitor body movements, collision intensity, and direction.
- **Shoe Sensors**: Embedded pressure sensors to detect foot movement, stepping out of bounds, or illegal steps.

#### (2) **Smart Basketball**

- Built-in sensors: Detect the ball's speed, position, and contact details.
- Integration with wearables: Monitor illegal contacts (e.g., hand-checking or slapping the ball).

#### (3) **Court Sensors**

- Pressure sensors under the floor: Track player movements, positions, and foot placement in real-time.
- Camera system: Capture player actions from multiple angles and use AI algorithms to identify fouls (e.g., pushing, grabbing).

### 2. **AI Algorithm Analysis**

- **Action Recognition**: Use computer vision and motion capture algorithms to analyze player movements against rules.
- **Collision Intensity Detection**: Determine if the intensity of contact exceeds foul thresholds using sensor data.
- **Rule Matching**: Compare sensor data with a built-in rule database to decide on fouls in real-time.

### 3. **Real-Time Feedback System**

- Penalty Notifications: Display foul decisions via screens on the court or through players' devices.
- Replay Support: Provide slow-motion replays to explain foul calls, helping both sides understand the rationale.

### 4. **Feasibility and Challenges**

- **Advantages**:
  - More objective and fair decisions.
  - Reduce disputes caused by foul controversies.
  - Add a sense of technology to casual games.
- **Challenges**:
  - Equipment cost: Making smart devices affordable for widespread use.
  - Data accuracy: The AI algorithm requires sufficient training data to minimize errors.
  - Rule adaptation: Setting reasonable penalty thresholds to avoid being overly strict.

Such a system is not only suitable for casual games with friends but also for amateur or semi-professional leagues. If you're looking to gather investments for this idea, you can emphasize the potential market for integrating technology into sports and focus on:

1. **Prototype Development**: Showcase a small-scale working model to attract investors.
2. **Target Audience**: Highlight applications for amateur games, training camps, or sports academies.
3. **Scalability**: Mention how it can expand to professional leagues in the future.

## 🚤 **AI-Powered Underwater Fish Detection Project**

### Help bring next-generation fishing intelligence to life

Many mid-age anglers love spending their weekends on the lake or out at sea searching for the perfect fishing spot. But finding fish is still often based on guesswork, expensive equipment, or pure luck. I believe we can change that—with AI.

I'm building an **AI-powered solution** that helps boat-based fishers locate fish more accurately, efficiently, and affordably. Your sponsorship will help make this open-source project a reality.

### 🎣 **🌊 The Vision**

Create an affordable, portable underwater imaging device powered by modern computer vision so that everyday fishers can:

- **See real-time underwater activity**
- **Detect and count fish automatically**
- **Estimate fish density**
- **Find the best spot to start fishing**

This is inspired by how many experienced fishers search for the perfect spot—now enhanced by cutting-edge AI.

---

### 🧠 **How It Works**

1. A compact underwater camera attaches to your boat and streams live video.
2. Vision AI models analyze the feed to detect fish species, count them, and estimate overall density.
3. When the density reaches a certain threshold, the system alerts the fisher:
   “This is a promising spot!”
4. All processing aims to be optimized for small edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano).

### 🌟 **Why This Project Matters**

- **Affordable alternative** to expensive commercial fish finders
- **Open source**, customizable, hackable
- **Useful for recreational anglers, researchers, and conservationists**
- **Great real-world application of AI, computer vision, and edge computing**
- Builds a community for people who love both **fishing** and **technology**

### 🛠️ **What Sponsorship Supports**

Your sponsorship helps fund:

- Dataset collection (underwater footage)
- Model training using YOLO/RT-DETR
- Hardware prototypes (camera, housing, mini-computer)
- Real-world testing on lakes and seashores
- Open-source documentation, tutorials, and demos

Even small contributions help me push this idea forward and release it for everyone.
