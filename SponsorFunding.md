## Project 1 - Crime AI

```md
I need some sponsors!

Here is my WIP project:

- Gather the data from the history for all criminal events in my city
- Take the live feed from different resources (e.g. police reports, call centers, governments, witnesses etc.)
- Do the data cleansing and remove outliners
- Split the data set for training and test data
- Choose the best ML algorithm and use it to analyze the data
- Predict the highest freqenent days/hours for all particular zones
- Notify the police stations and recommend them to prepare more on the crime peek days/hours

Here's a high-level overview of how I will proceed:

1. **Data Gathering**: Collect historical data on criminal events in our city from relevant sources such as police records, crime databases, news reports, and government statistics. Additionally, set up mechanisms to gather live data from sources like police reports, emergency call centers, government agencies, and eyewitness accounts.

2. **Data Cleansing and Preprocessing**: Cleanse the collected data to remove inconsistencies, errors, and outliers. This may involve tasks such as handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and identifying and removing erroneous entries.

3. **Data Splitting**: Split the cleaned dataset into training and testing subsets. The training dataset will be used to train our machine learning model, while the testing dataset will be used to evaluate its performance.

4. **Model Selection and Training**: Choose the most appropriate machine learning algorithm for our problem. This could involve experimenting with different algorithms such as decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks. Train the selected model using the training dataset.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of our trained model using the testing dataset. Common evaluation metrics for classification tasks include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Choose the evaluation metrics that are most relevant to our project's objectives.

6. **Prediction**: Once our model is trained and evaluated, use it to make predictions on new data. In this case, use the trained model to predict the highest frequency days and hours for criminal events in particular zones of our city.

7. **Notification and Recommendation**: Develop a mechanism to notify relevant authorities, such as police stations, about the predicted high-frequency days and hours for criminal activity in specific zones. Additionally, provide recommendations on how they can prepare and allocate resources accordingly.

8. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploy our model and notification system in a production environment. Continuously monitor the system's performance and update the model as needed with new data and insights.

9. **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback loop to collect data on the effectiveness of our predictions and recommendations. Use this feedback to refine and improve our model over time.

10. **Documentation and Maintenance**: Document the entire project, including data sources, preprocessing steps, model selection, training, and deployment processes. Regularly maintain and update our system to ensure its effectiveness and relevance over time.

## Project 2 - Basketball AI

```md
## Idea: Smart Basketball

To ensure fair foul judgments in basketball games with friends, I am creating a system that leverages **sensor technology and AI algorithms**.

### 1. **Smart Basketball Court System**

Integrate sensors and AI to record match data in real-time and automatically determine fouls.

#### (1) **Wearable Devices**

- **Smart Wristbands or Protective Gear**: Each player wears lightweight smart devices (e.g., wristbands, knee pads) equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and pressure sensors to monitor body movements, collision intensity, and direction.
- **Shoe Sensors**: Embedded pressure sensors to detect foot movement, stepping out of bounds, or illegal steps.

#### (2) **Smart Basketball**

- Built-in sensors: Detect the ball's speed, position, and contact details.
- Integration with wearables: Monitor illegal contacts (e.g., hand-checking or slapping the ball).

#### (3) **Court Sensors**

- Pressure sensors under the floor: Track player movements, positions, and foot placement in real-time.
- Camera system: Capture player actions from multiple angles and use AI algorithms to identify fouls (e.g., pushing, grabbing).

### 2. **AI Algorithm Analysis**

- **Action Recognition**: Use computer vision and motion capture algorithms to analyze player movements against rules.
- **Collision Intensity Detection**: Determine if the intensity of contact exceeds foul thresholds using sensor data.
- **Rule Matching**: Compare sensor data with a built-in rule database to decide on fouls in real-time.

### 3. **Real-Time Feedback System**

- Penalty Notifications: Display foul decisions via screens on the court or through players' devices.
- Replay Support: Provide slow-motion replays to explain foul calls, helping both sides understand the rationale.

### 4. **Feasibility and Challenges**

- **Advantages**:
  - More objective and fair decisions.
  - Reduce disputes caused by foul controversies.
  - Add a sense of technology to casual games.
- **Challenges**:
  - Equipment cost: Making smart devices affordable for widespread use.
  - Data accuracy: The AI algorithm requires sufficient training data to minimize errors.
  - Rule adaptation: Setting reasonable penalty thresholds to avoid being overly strict.

Such a system is not only suitable for casual games with friends but also for amateur or semi-professional leagues. If you're looking to gather investments for this idea, you can emphasize the potential market for integrating technology into sports and focus on:

1. **Prototype Development**: Showcase a small-scale working model to attract investors.
2. **Target Audience**: Highlight applications for amateur games, training camps, or sports academies.
3. **Scalability**: Mention how it can expand to professional leagues in the future.

## Project 3 - Fish

```md
I have a good idea now and want to put on my github sponsor page.

I see lots of mid-age men love fishing. I belive a good AI-powered solution can help them finding fish more efficiently.

Here is a basic idea:

1. This is for fisher who drive boat to the lakes or sea to fish.
2. A camera to be used to put underwater to capture the images and videos.
3. Use Vision AI to detect fish and count.
4. If the desity is good enough, then it is a good place to start fishing.

How to make this idea better to put on my github sponsor page to attract people to sponsor me?
```

Here's a polished, engaging version of your idea that's suitable for a **GitHub Sponsors page** and helps attract supporters. It highlights the **vision**, the **value**, and the **innovation**, while sounding professional and exciting.

## 🚤 **AI-Powered Underwater Fish Detection Project**

### Help bring next-generation fishing intelligence to life

Many mid-age anglers love spending their weekends on the lake or out at sea searching for the perfect fishing spot. But finding fish is still often based on guesswork, expensive equipment, or pure luck. I believe we can change that-with AI.

I'm building an **AI-powered solution** that helps boat-based fishers locate fish more accurately, efficiently, and affordably.
Your sponsorship will help make this open-source project a reality.

---

### 🎣 **🌊 The Vision**

Create an affordable, portable underwater imaging device powered by modern computer vision so that everyday fishers can:

- **See real-time underwater activity**
- **Detect and count fish automatically**
- **Estimate fish density**
- **Find the best spot to start fishing**

This is inspired by how many experienced fishers search for the perfect spot-now enhanced by cutting-edge AI.

---

### 🧠 **How It Works**

1. A compact underwater camera attaches to your boat and streams live video.
2. Vision AI models analyze the feed to detect fish species, count them, and estimate overall density.
3. When the density reaches a certain threshold, the system alerts the fisher:
   “This is a promising spot!”
4. All processing aims to be optimized for small edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi, Jetson Nano).

---

### 🌟 **Why This Project Matters**

- **Affordable alternative** to expensive commercial fish finders
- **Open source**, customizable, hackable
- **Useful for recreational anglers, researchers, and conservationists**
- **Great real-world application of AI, computer vision, and edge computing**
- Builds a community for people who love both **fishing** and **technology**
